I am a Machine Learining Researcher, currently working on my PhD Thesis at the University of Oslo.

#### Research Interests

I am interested in Bayesian paradigms and probabilistic machine learning techniques, particularly generative modelling, normalizing flows, invertible neural networks, and encoder/decoder models. I am also looking at attention mechanisms in vision transformers, graph neural networks, as well as representation learning and methods for incorporating contextual priors in deep learning.

From a mathematical perspective, I am interested in representation theory, linear- and functional analysis, and Lie groups. In terms of applied mathematics and signal processing, I am interested in frame theory, information theory, and generalised Fourier- and wavelet analysis.
