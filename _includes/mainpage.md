I am a Machine Learining Researcher in the [Digital Signal Processing and Image analysis (DSB)](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/dsb/), currently working on my PhD Thesis at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/). I am also part of [Visual Intelligence (VI)](https://www.visual-intelligence.no/), a centre for research-based innovation ([SFI](https://www.uio.no/english/about/organisation/exellent-centers/centres-for-research-based-innovation/index.html)).

#### Research Interests

I am interested in Bayesian paradigms and probabilistic machine learning techniques for deep learning, particularly generative modelling, normalizing flows, with particular focus on the intersection of invertible neural networks and encoder/decoder models. I am also looking at attention mechanisms in vision transformers, graph neural networks, as well as representation learning and methods for incorporating contextual priors in deep learning.
