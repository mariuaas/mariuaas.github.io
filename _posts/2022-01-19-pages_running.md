Finally got my Github Pages site up and running. I managed to spend an entire day on messing about with settings only to then accidently delete everything. Thankfully, I got everything back up and running again quickly. To celebrate, let us partake in an equation:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0.
$$

This works beautifully, thanks to <cite><a href="https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/How-to-add-mathjax-to-minimal-mistakes/">this illuminating post</a></cite>.

I plan to add some short blog posts on my research and news about publications, talks, and lectures here when I have the time. Hopefully often, but not too often.
